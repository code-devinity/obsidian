- Expanded to today (expanded topics):

### 1) Design your workflows: how micro-interactions shape productivity
- Hook: Small UI/UX touches change big outcomes in everyday work.
- Core idea: Map your workflow touchpoints (from prompt to action) and add micro-interactions (visual cues, haptic feedback, tiny confirmations) to reduce cognitive load.
- Practical angles:
  - Case study: a 15-minute daily process and the micro-interactions that saved 3 minutes per task.
  - Checklist: design principles (clarity, consistency, feedback) applied to a common tool (docs, code review, or issue tracking).
  - A/B idea: two versions of a small UI cue; measure decision time and error rate.
- Post formats to test: carousel (before/after), quick-thread (3 tips), or a short reel/story outline.
- Sample post outline:
  - Title hook
  - 3 concrete micro-interactions you added
  - Before/after impact (time saved, fewer mistakes)
  - How readers can implement in their own workflow
- Reader payoff: actionable steps to implement micro-interactions in common tools.

### 2) Story editing for engineers and builders: turning code into narratives
- Hook: Your code tells a story—make it compelling to humans first.
- Core idea: Translate a technical problem and solution into a narrative arc (problem → approach → outcome) readable by non-experts.
- Practical angles:
  - Step-by-step method for turning a PR into a storytelling piece.
  - Examples: define the character (user/stakeholder), stakes, conflict, resolution.
  - Quick templates: problem-solution-result mini-article outline.
- Post formats: thread with a mini-story, or article-style post with a before/after story.
- Reader payoff: a repeatable framework readers can apply to their own code or projects.

### 3) Productivity rituals of high-output teams: 15-minute blocks that compound
- Hook: Tiny daily rituals compound into big productivity gains.
- Core idea: Define micro-rituals (e.g., 15-minute standups, 10-minute planning sprints, 5-minute retros) and show why they work.
- Practical angles:
  - A week-in-the-life example of a high-output team.
  - Frameworks: timeboxing, rapid feedback loops, and ritual cadences.
  - A simple metric to track ritual impact (time-to-decide, blockers resolved, morale signal).
- Post formats: checklist-style post, infographic of a week cadence, or a short explainer video outline.
- Reader payoff: how to implement in small teams with tight budgets.

### 4) From data to decision: visual storytelling with simple dashboards
- Hook: Data is only as persuasive as the story you tell.
- Core idea: Build dashboards that illuminate decisions, not overwhelm with numbers.
- Practical angles:
  - Design tips: choose 1–2 core metrics, color choices that reduce cognitive load, storytelling through sequence (lead with insight, support with data).
  - Case studies: a single-page dashboard that changed a decision.
  - How-to: turning raw data into a narrative slide or post.
- Post formats: carousel with before/after dashboards, quick-thread on dashboard storytelling, or a mini-guide.
- Reader payoff: a repeatable dashboard blueprint readers can adapt.

### 5) The language of code: how vocabulary and culture influence software design
- Hook: The words we use shape code, architecture, and collaboration.
- Core idea: Explore how naming, conventions, and cultural context influence design decisions.
- Practical angles:
  - Examples: naming patterns, API design language, and how vernacular affects readability and maintenance.
  - Exercises: “rename a module” exercise to reveal how language changes understanding.
  - guidelines: a mini cheat sheet for inclusive, clear code/documentation language.
- Post formats: thread with before/after naming, or a short explainer carousel.
- Reader payoff: practical naming conventions readers can adopt.
