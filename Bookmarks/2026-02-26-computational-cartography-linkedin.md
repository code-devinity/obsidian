summary: "The post proposes ‘Computational Cartography’: using Python, geospatial data, and animation to narrate epic journeys as interactive maps. It frames code as a storytelling medium with strong education potential, not just a utility tool. Worth saving as a high-leverage content and product concept at the intersection of engineering and narrative learning."

# Computational Cartography (LinkedIn)

## Key takeaway
Narrative + geospatial interactivity is a differentiated content/EdTech format that can become a repeatable series.

## Short notes
- 4-part framework: map scaffold, world context, temporal animation, interactive interface.
- Includes demos/code references for Ramayan, Mahabharat, and LOTR.
