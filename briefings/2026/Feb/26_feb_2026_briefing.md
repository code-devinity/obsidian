# Daily X Briefing — 2026-02-26 06:08 PM Asia

## Status
❌ Could not fetch X home timeline.

## Failure Reason
- \'xurl auth status\' reports: **No apps registered**.
- Without an authenticated X app/user, timeline data cannot be retrieved.

## Next Fix Step
1. On this machine, register an X app in xurl (outside agent context) and complete OAuth login:
   - \'xurl auth apps add\'
   - \'xurl auth oauth2\'
2. Re-run this daily briefing job.

## Notes
- No tweet analysis was possible today due to missing authentication.
- No video ideas extracted.
