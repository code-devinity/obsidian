## Developer Tools
1. **OpenAI Codex × Figma integration**  
   “Code-to-design loop” tightening could reduce handoff friction between product/design/engineering teams and speed iteration cycles.

## Tech Business
1. **Anthropic story dominates HN discussions (“Statement from Dario Amodei…” )**  
   High engagement indicates defense/public-sector AI positioning is becoming a first-order business narrative.

3. **Reddit r/artificial thread: “hottest job in AI” (Field Deployment Engineer signal)**  
   Reinforces shift from model R&D hiring to enterprise implementation/operations roles.  
   Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1rfv8ew/hottest_job_in_ai_right_now/

## Interesting Threads (Reddit/HN)
- HN: Statement from Dario Amodei on Department of War discussions (very high comment velocity).  
- HN: “What Claude Code Chooses” (agent behavior, developer trust, workflow implications).  
- r/LocalLLaMA: Model + quantization recommendations for 16GB Mac Mini M4 local workflows.  
- r/artificial: “Hottest job in AI right now” (deployment-facing roles gaining visibility).  

## Optional YouTube Insight
- **Two Minute Papers** latest video (“Adobe & NVIDIA’s new tech...”) points to real-time creative tooling leaps becoming a recurring content/market theme.

## Quick Hits
- X monitoring was **partially available** (best-effort): sam altman surfaced; several target handles could not be reliably fetched in this run.  
- OpenAI published a security report on malicious AI use (Feb 2026).  
- Google announced statewide AI training access initiative in Massachusetts.

## Action items
1. Track whether Codex × Figma materially improves design→implementation cycle times for small teams.  
2. Watch MoE deployment/tooling discussions (HF + open-source stacks) for practical cost/perf tactics.  
3. For local AI setups, benchmark 8B/14B quantized models on Apple Silicon as a recurring creator/dev niche.
